                In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                collect, use and disclose your information to the extent
                necessary to allow them to perform certain services they provide
                to us. Certain third-party services, such as payment gateways

                abide by security standards imposed on them, such as the Payment
                Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is a set

                processors that accept, process, store or transmit credit card
                information maintain a secure environment. All direct payment
                gateways we utilize adhere to PCI-DSS, which is a joint effort
                of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover,

                under PCI-DSS, may store your purchase transaction data for only
                as long as is necessary to complete the transaction and
